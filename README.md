# Pawpal

## Our Task
To create a functional web application showcasing the skills we've learned thus far.

Pawpal is an interactive web application where the user is able to input a desired location within a specified radius to search for adoptable animals. On the homepage, the user is able to view three adoptable animals, a search bar, and a favorites button that leads to a modal that may contain any animals the user may have bookmarked. After the user clicks the search button, the user will be led to a results page containing a list of animals that are adoptable based on the parameters specified in the location and search radius. A filter button containing a variety of attributes will also be available to filter out specific traits the user may want to apply such as gender and age. If the user wants to save a certain pet profile to view for later, they will be able to do so by pressing the paw print located next to each pet's image. The user will be able to easily retrieve the saved pet by clicking the favorites button that is available on the home page and results page.
